# english-thesaurus

Simple english theasurus was one of the first projects I did in Python. 

Word - definition pairs are stored in a JSON file.
It should be noted that I didn't compile the JSON file myself, but have instead used one provided as course material 
in the following Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

I have reorganized the code a bit and converted it into a web app using Flask and some basic HTMl & CSS.
I have uploaded the app onto the Heroku web server, where it should be accesable for a live demo on the following link: https://english-thesaurus.herokuapp.com
